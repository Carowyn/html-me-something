                <h3>&#10070; <u>Where I began.</u></h4>
                <p>I started off working in high school at Burger King. I left that job after a
                couple months because my grades dropped a little, and they wouldn't let me reduce
                hours or get off earlier. A couple years later, as a senior in high school, I worked
                at Walmart. I gained my basis in customer service there.</p>

                <p>I took Keyboarding each year in highschool, until as a Senior I took a technical
                class specifically in Microsoft Powerpoint. I've always been interested in computers,
                I just didn't know what path to take.</p>

                <p>As an adult, my work history has been rocky while trying to find the right fit
                between what I can do, and what I am good at. Between 2003 and 2009, due to being
                in a manipulative relationship that affected working, I prefer not to discuss much
                about the lenghth of jobs, and focus instead on skills I learned.</p>

                <p>Most of my positions have involved customer service. However, that is not where
                my interests lie. I prefer things a bit less...peopley. I don't want to answer phone
                call after phone call to just be yelled at. I don't want to stand at a counter and
                take an order. I don't want to scan everything in and cash people out.What I can
                bring from those positions, though, is an ability to handle client requests, the
                ability to listen to what the client wants and translate it into what I can do or
                make for them. I also have the ability to learn whatever job and position specific
                skills are needed.</p>

                <p>In May of 2009, I went to Job Corps. I was tired of not being able to stay in any
                certain job for any real length of time. I thought that maybe getting away and learning
                some "real" skills would help with that. Because I have my high school diploma and because
                I tested well, I was able to just start with the Advanced Training program there. This
                one was TCU - Transportation Communication Union. I learned math and clerical skills,
                as well as additional Keyboarding. I assisted other students with learning Microsoft
                Office among other things. I also completed training for Rail Freight Clerk. When I
                completed training a year later. I had finally discovered the toxicity of the
                relationship I was in, and I chose to stay in the Kansas City area instead of going home.</p>

                <p>I've tried several different things since that time, and also fell back on my customer service
                skills as well. None of it has been what I enjoy.</p>

                <h3>&#10070; <u>Where I'm at.</u></h3>
                <p>Well, technically right now I'm sitting in my living room, a few days away from starting the
                second section of a LaunchCode class. &#9786;</p>
                <p>Right now, I've learned Python basics, and am in the process of learning HTML
                and CSS. I anticipate learning JavaScript in this unit as well. Afterwards, they
                will give us a choice between 3 different area specific tracks that will lead us
                towards having job ready skills in our geographical area. I'm not currently working.
                I wanted to give this program my <em>entire</em> focus so that I can learn everything
                fully. I <strong>LOVE</strong> this class so far. It hasbeen so challenging, and I
                get so veryexcited when a new thing works!</p>
                <p>I am(was?) part of Phi Theta Kappa while working on a 2 year A.S. in Biology. Due to
                life, I had to stop to try to work some more. While I love Biology, I think that much
                extra schooling at this time in my life won't put me on the path to a career until too
                late to grow adequately in it. I am finding that I love learning this <em>even more</em> than I
                love Biology!!!

                <p>My goal is to land an internship through LaunchCode. From there, I want to learn as
                much as I can, as fully as I can so I can excel at the position I'm interning for.
                I want this to be a career I can learn and grow in until retirement. This is a life-
                changing opportunity for me!</p>
